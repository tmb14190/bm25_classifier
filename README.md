# bm25_classifier
Classifier created as part of my dissertation project to link a combination of tweets about a fake news story, to a set of politifact artciles about fake news stories.
BM25 is a retrieval function to get the best search results using a bag of words model, with the idea to get the specific article relating to the tweets as the article with the highest score.
